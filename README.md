Navball library for Arduino, using KerbalSimpit to connect KSP to the Arduino

The goal of this library is to be able to draw a navball on a screen connected to an Arduino, in order to integrate it in a custom KSP controller.

This library use the Simpit library to connect to KSP. Version 2.1.0 or higher of Simpit is needed.
